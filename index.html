		<h1>Netpbm Viewer</h1>
		<h2>View your PPM, PGM and PBM files online</h2>

		<p>After using the <a href="http://openkinect.org/">OpenKinect</a> library to communicate with the Kinect, I had produced many PPM and PGM files that I couldn't open. Furthermore, all the applications I found that could open the files on Mac OS X were massively bloated. What I really wanted was a website that would just convert the files to PNG images. I couldn't find it, so I made this.</p>
		<p>Drag your PPM, PGM or PBM files onto the dashed area below to convert them to PNG images in your browser. Right-click the image to save to your machine.</p>

				<div id="landing-zone"><span>Drag netpbm files here</span></div>
				<ul id="image-list"></ul>
